description: Bounded workflow runner. Executes only allowlisted deterministic shell steps from /fig_drive and stops at host, human, patch, polish, release, accepted, and golden boundaries.
---

Run a bounded figure workflow until the next non-automatic boundary.

**Usage**: `/fig_run <name> --mode <mode> --goal "<goal>" [--execute] [--format json]`

Run from the plugin root:

```bash
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run.py <name> --mode review --goal "<goal>"
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run.py <name> --mode review --goal "<goal>" --format json
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run.py <name> --mode review --goal "<goal>" --execute
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run.py <name> --mode review --goal "<goal>" --record --runs-root /tmp/fig-run-runs
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run.py <name> --mode review --goal "<goal>" --no-record
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run_journal.py <name>
```

`/fig_run` is a conservative executor over `/fig_drive`. It asks the driver
for one next action, executes only allowlisted deterministic shell actions, then
asks the driver again. It stops when the next action requires host vision,
human judgment, patch handoff, SVG polish handoff, existing adjudication repair,
accepted state, tracked-golden export, golden roll-forward, release approval, or
any unsupported mutation.

Default mode is plan-only. Without `--execute`, the command emits what would be
run and does not mutate fixture source, exports, accepted state, or golden
state. Plan-only runs do not write a journal unless `--record` is passed.
Output is JSON by default; `--format json` is accepted as an explicit output
compatibility spelling.

## Execution Policy

The executable actions are allowed only when the driver attaches no
`stop_boundary`. The runner also revalidates that each shell command matches
the current fixture before executing; an allowlisted action with a mismatched
or malformed command stops as `not_executable_action`.

- `run_compile` -> `bash scripts/compile.sh examples/<name>/<name>.tex`
- `run_adjudicate` -> `uv run python3 scripts/critique_adjudication.py scaffold <name>`
  only when `critique_adjudication.yaml` is missing
- `run_export` -> `uv run python3 scripts/run_export.py <name>` only for
  that exact fixture command and only for draft generated exports where
  `acceptance_state: NOT_DECLARED`, `export_state: MISSING | STALE`, and
  `critique_state: FRESH | NOT_REQUIRED`
- `run_fig_loop` -> `uv run python3 scripts/fig_loop.py <name> --goal ... --json`

`run_adjudicate` is allowed only for initial scaffold; existing adjudication
files, including stale or invalid files, still require manual repair.
`run_export` is allowed only for draft fixtures whose acceptance has not yet
been declared (`acceptance_state: NOT_DECLARED`) and whose generated exports
are missing or stale. Accepted fixtures, explicitly not-accepted fixtures,
tracked-golden export state, closeout boundaries, `--force-golden`, and
`--skip-critique` remain explicit manual actions.
`/fig_loop` is allowed because it is verify-only and writes bounded run evidence
under `.scratch/fig-loop-runs/`. The runner always stops on `/fig_critique`
because that is a host-vision operation, not a shell command.

## Output JSON contract

`schema: figure-agent.run.v1` with these fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | string | `figure-agent.run.v1` |
| `fixture` | string | figure name |
| `mode` | string | driver mode |
| `goal` | string | passthrough goal |
| `execute` | bool | whether allowed shell commands were executed |
| `max_steps` | int | safety cap |
| `executable_actions` | list | current allowlist: `run_adjudicate`, `run_compile`, `run_export`, `run_fig_loop` |
| `steps` | list | driver action plus execution result for each iteration |
| `final_action` | string | last driver action |
| `final_safe_command` | string or null | last command selected by driver |
| `final_stop_boundary` | string or null | last driver stop boundary |
| `final_stop_reason` | string | runner reason for stopping |
| `executed_count` | int | number of shell commands actually run |
| `boundary_handoff` | object, optional | present for non-`complete` stops; explanatory only |
| `journal` | object, optional | reference to the non-authoritative `.scratch/fig-run-runs/` record unless `--no-record` is used |
| `journal_error` | object, optional | recording failure details; run payload remains usable |

Step entries include the embedded `/fig_drive` JSON under `driver` so an outer
agent can inspect the exact status, blocker, and next-action evidence used for
the decision. A successful executed step may have `stop_reason: null`; the
runner then re-queries the driver for the next action.

### Run Journal

When `--execute` is passed, the CLI records each `/fig_run` payload under:

```text
.scratch/fig-run-runs/<timestamp>-<name>/
├── run_manifest.json
├── run.json
├── steps/
│   └── step_001.json
└── stop.md
```

Use `--record` to record a plan-only run. Use `--runs-root <path>` to redirect
journals in tests or dogfood runs. Use `--no-record` for stdout-only behavior,
including execute mode.

The journal is non-authoritative evidence. It exists so a later session can
inspect what the runner saw and why it stopped. It preserves the public payload,
so `safe_command` fields may appear inside `run.json` and step JSON as evidence
of what the live driver selected. Those strings are not resume commands and are
not permission to execute stale state; rerun live `/fig_status` and
`/fig_drive` before continuing.

If recording fails after a run, the CLI still prints the public run payload with
`journal_error` instead of hiding the result behind a traceback.

There is no executable `--resume` or `--resume-latest` flag. To continue after
an interruption, inspect `stop.md` only as context, or run:

```bash
uv run python3 scripts/fig_run_journal.py <name>
```

That summary is also non-authoritative: it names the latest journal stop,
required actor, stale fixture evidence, and closeout checks, but it never emits
a replay command. Continue by rerunning live `/fig_status <name>` and
`/fig_drive <name> --mode <mode> --goal "<goal>" --dry-run`. Use
`/fig_run --execute` again only for the fresh driver-selected action.

### `boundary_handoff`

When the runner stops before `complete`, it emits an additive
`schema: figure-agent.boundary-handoff.v1` object. This object is a compact
explanation of the stop, not a second router and not permission to bypass a
boundary.

Fields:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `action` | copied from the final `/fig_drive` action |
| `stop_boundary` | copied from the final `/fig_drive` stop boundary |
| `required_actor` | one of `host_llm`, `human`, `svg_editor`, `release_operator`, `workflow_agent` |
| `blocking_reason` | compact driver/runner reason; command failures include `stderr_tail` |
| `evidence_refs` | copied from `next_action_summary` or fallback driver/runner evidence |
| `allowed_scope` | copied from `next_action_summary`, except deferred patch/source boundaries |
| `forbidden_scope` | copied from `next_action_summary`, except deferred patch/source boundaries |
| `closeout_checks` | checks to perform after the required actor acts |
| `continuation_guidance` | always says to rerun live status and driver state first |

When the final driver summary came from a `/fig_loop` `basin_detected`
checkpoint, `boundary_handoff` also includes `basin_summary` and its
`closeout_checks` begin with the basin's `recommended_step_out_actions`. Treat
this as a signal to leave the local patch loop for second-opinion review,
human art-direction/domain review, or reference/briefing contract repair before
rerunning live `/fig_loop` and `/fig_drive`.

`boundary_handoff.continuation_guidance` intentionally does not contain an
executable resume command. Resume/replay behavior is out of scope for
`/fig_run`.

Patch/source-mutation boundaries are explicitly deferred. If the final driver
action is `patch_handoff_stop`, the handoff reports
`deferred_boundary: patch_source_mutation_deferred_until_70c`, uses
`allowed_scope: ["read-only"]`, and does not surface patch edit scope.

## Stop Reasons

- `plan_only` — command would be executable, but `--execute` was not passed.
- `host_boundary` — host vision or slash command required.
- `not_executable_action` — driver selected an unsupported action, or an
  allowlisted action failed its extra safety predicate.
- `command_failed` — an executed command returned non-zero.
- `complete` — driver selected `complete`.
- `repeated_executable_action` — a successful command was followed by the same
  driver action and shell command again, so the runner stopped instead of
  repeating a no-progress loop.
- `max_steps_exceeded` — the runner hit the safety cap before state advanced to
  a boundary.

## When To Use

Use `/fig_run` when the user wants the plugin to proceed through safe mechanical
steps without asking for each compile. Use `/fig_drive --dry-run` when you only
need a recommendation. Use the lower-level slash commands directly when the
user is intentionally operating one specific stage.

`/fig_run` does not remove human gates. It only removes unnecessary manual
copy-paste for deterministic shell work the driver already selected.
`/fig_drive --mode final --dry-run` is intentionally driver-only; `/fig_run`
does not execute final mode because final readiness is an explanatory
human/release preset, not a new automation lane.
